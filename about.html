          <h2>Short Bio</h2>
        <h3> I was born and raised in Knoxville, TN for most of my life... . . .</h3><br>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">We moved to Florida briefly when I was a child. I'e stayed in Atlanta, GA for a while.  Hickory, North Carolina was briefly my home.  I've stayed in Manhattan, NY briefly too.  I was born in 1977 and the world was a much better place then.  I was just a child when I took up a liking for the arts and music.  I went to grade school and graduated.  I went on to college.  I have 350 plus credit hours of undergrad work and no diploma yet.  I have certificates but no diploma. I am still in college studying Graphic Design/Web Design. The worst of worst happened to me and the best of the best in life!</p><br>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">I am an artist and a designer.  I'm just budding in this world.  It took me along time to get here.  Things get better all the time.  I get wiser with time and experience.If I knew then what I know now, I would've budded sooner I think.</p>
		<p style="font-size:18px;">I am slowly putting my portfolio on the internet and making websites for people as well.  I wanted to be a Social Influencer, but I have changed gears. </p>
		<p style="font-size:18px; margin: 10px auto 40px auto;">I am a mother as well.</p>
